%INTERPOLATE_FRAMES Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here

% joints structure = cell with number of frames
% and in each frame it contains all the joints and positions

joints_interpolated = cell(1,n_frames);

n_frames_joints = length(joints);

a = linspace(1,n_frames_joints,n_frames);

    joints_interpolated{1,cnt} = joints{1,floor(a(1,i))};
    cnt = cnt + 1;
